	<p>My name is Maia Woluchem and I'm an MCP1 way into headwraps, good songwriting, and mandarin oranges. Although I
	live in Cambridge now, I'm moving most recently from DC. I got out of there just in time, I guess. I spent four years
there doing policy research, writing a lot about housing, education, and the use of local data for social change. that
last piece is why am really excited to take this class. Data is a really powerful tool for advocacy, and I'd like
to use it to better advocate for equity in cities, providing a potentially more critical perspective on the ways
we think about its use in systems, technology, and in our lives. </p>

<p> Here's a cool visualization I made for PSet6 <a href="extras/stackedbars.html">here!</a></p>


<p> One of the ways I see data visualization being best used for advocacy was done a long time ago by W.E.B. DuBois for the World
	Fair. He, Booker T. Washington and Thomas Calloway created over 60 visualizations, all really simple but pretty striking. I love the visual treatment
	but also that they say so much without doing the most. An example and link are below!</p>
